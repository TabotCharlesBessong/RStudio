# Questions and Answers - Interactive Data Analysis

## Question 1: What does the interactive 3D data cube show us?

**Answer:** 
The interactive 3D data cube visualizes HR employee data across three key dimensions:
- **Education Level** (x-axis): Shows different levels of employee education (1-5 scale)
- **Department** (y-axis): Displays various company departments (Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales)
- **Quarter** (z-axis): Represents time periods (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

Each yellow dot represents data points (likely employees) positioned in this 3D space based on their education level, department, and the quarter being analyzed. This visualization allows us to:
- Identify patterns in employee distribution across departments and education levels over time
- Spot clusters or gaps in the data
- Perform OLAP operations like slice, dice, roll-up, and drill-down to analyze employee attrition patterns
- Understand the relationship between education, department placement, and temporal trends

The cube enables multidimensional analysis of the HR Employee Attrition dataset, making it easier to discover insights about workforce composition and potential attrition factors.
